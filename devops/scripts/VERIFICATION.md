## ✅ Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

1. **Directory Structure Reorganization** ✅
   - Renamed `infrastructure/` → `docker-infra/` for clarity
   - Organized into: `shared/`, `dev/`, `docker-infra/`, `kubernetes/`
   - Removed duplicate `dev/healthcare.sh` (kept root `healthcare.sh`)

2. **All Path References Updated** ✅
   - GitHub Actions workflow: All `infrastructure/` → `docker-infra/`
   - All scripts: Correct `../shared/utils.sh` references
   - Internal script references: All use `SCRIPT_DIR` correctly
   - Documentation: All paths updated

3. **Scripts Verified** ✅
   - All 7 Docker infrastructure scripts in `docker-infra/`
   - All scripts reference `shared/utils.sh` correctly
   - All scripts reference each other correctly
   - Main entry point (`healthcare.sh`) routes correctly

4. **Integration Issues Fixed** ✅
   - Added `INFRA_ALREADY_HANDLED` flag to prevent duplicate operations
   - GitHub Actions jobs and `deploy.sh` properly coordinated
   - No redundancy between CI/CD jobs and deployment script

## ✅ Path References Verification

### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

All script paths verified:

- ✅ `devops/scripts/docker-infra/health-check.sh`
- ✅ `devops/scripts/docker-infra/backup.sh`
- ✅ `devops/scripts/docker-infra/diagnose.sh`
- ✅ `devops/scripts/docker-infra/restore.sh`
- ✅ `devops/scripts/docker-infra/verify.sh`
- ✅ `devops/scripts/shared/utils.sh`
- ✅ `devops/scripts/docker-infra/setup-directories.sh`
- ✅ `devops/scripts/docker-infra/deploy.sh`
- ✅ Server paths: `/opt/healthcare-backend/devops/scripts/docker-infra/`

### Script Internal References

All scripts correctly reference:

- ✅ `source "${SCRIPT_DIR}/../shared/utils.sh"` in all `docker-infra/` scripts
- ✅ Scripts reference each other using `"${SCRIPT_DIR}/<script>.sh"`
- ✅ No hardcoded paths
- ✅ No old `infrastructure/` references

### Documentation References

- ✅ `devops/scripts/README.md` - All paths updated to `docker-infra/`
- ✅ `devops/scripts/docker-infra/INFRASTRUCTURE_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md` - Updated
  with implementation status
- ✅ `devops/scripts/kubernetes/README.md` - References `docker-infra/`
  correctly
- ✅ `devops/README.md` - References consolidated scripts

### Docker Compose Configuration

- ✅ `devops/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml` - Profiles configured
  - Infrastructure profile: `postgres`, `dragonfly`, `openvidu-server`, `coturn`
  - App profile: `api`, `worker`
  - Bind mount volumes configured
  - Health checks configured

---

## ✅ Integration Verification

### Problem Identified & Fixed

**Issue**: Redundancy between GitHub Actions jobs and `deploy.sh`

- GitHub Actions jobs were doing: backup → recreate → restore → verify
- Then `deploy.sh` was ALSO trying to do: backup → recreate → restore → verify
- This caused duplicate operations and potential conflicts

**Solution**: Added `INFRA_ALREADY_HANDLED` flag

- When `INFRA_ALREADY_HANDLED=true`, `deploy.sh` skips infrastructure operations
- Infrastructure operations are handled by separate GitHub Actions jobs
- `deploy.sh` only handles application deployment in CI/CD mode

### Workflow Integration

**Job Flow**:

```
detect-changes
  ↓
check-infrastructure (always runs)
  ↓
[IF infra-changed OR infra-unhealthy]
  → backup-infrastructure
  → [IF infra-unhealthy AND NOT infra-changed]
      → debug-infrastructure
  → [IF infra-changed OR debug-failed]
      → recreate-infrastructure
      → restore-backup
      → verify-infrastructure
  ↓
[IF app-changed]
  → build-application
  ↓
deploy (always runs, but uses INFRA_ALREADY_HANDLED flag)
  → Calls deploy.sh with INFRA_ALREADY_HANDLED=true
  → deploy.sh skips infrastructure ops, only deploys app
```

**Environment Variables Passed to deploy.sh**:

- `INFRA_CHANGED` - From `detect-changes` job
- `APP_CHANGED` - From `detect-changes` job
- `INFRA_HEALTHY` - From `check-infrastructure` job
- `INFRA_STATUS` - From `check-infrastructure` job
- `BACKUP_ID` - From `backup-infrastructure` job (if backup was created)
- `INFRA_ALREADY_HANDLED` - Set by deploy job based on whether infrastructure
  jobs ran

### deploy.sh Decision Logic

1. **IF `INFRA_CHANGED == true`**:
   - **IF `INFRA_ALREADY_HANDLED == true`** (CI/CD mode):
     - Skip backup/recreate/restore (already done by jobs)
     - Verify infrastructure
     - Deploy app if `APP_CHANGED == true`
   - **ELSE** (standalone mode):
     - Do backup → recreate → restore → verify
     - Deploy app if `APP_CHANGED == true`

2. **IF `INFRA_UNHEALTHY` AND `INFRA_CHANGED == false`**:
   - **IF `INFRA_ALREADY_HANDLED == true`** (CI/CD mode):
     - Skip debug/recreate (already done by jobs)
     - Verify infrastructure
     - Deploy app if `APP_CHANGED == true`
   - **ELSE** (standalone mode):
     - Try diagnose/auto-fix
     - If fix fails: backup → recreate → restore → verify
     - Deploy app if `APP_CHANGED == true`

3. **IF `INFRA_HEALTHY == true` AND `APP_CHANGED == true`**:
   - Deploy app only (no infrastructure operations needed)

4. **IF `INFRA_HEALTHY == true` AND `APP_CHANGED == false`**:
   - Skip deployment (no changes)

## ✅ Implementation Details

### 1. Change Detection ✅

- Uses `dorny/paths-filter@v2` action
- Detects infrastructure changes: Dockerfiles, docker-compose.prod.yml,
  migrations
- Detects application changes: src/, package.json, Dockerfile
- Outputs: `infra-changed`, `app-changed`

### 2. Health Check ✅

- Runs `health-check.sh` on server
- Parses JSON output
- Sets outputs: `infra-healthy`, `infra-status`
- Exit codes: 0=healthy, 1=minor, 2=critical, 3=missing

### 3. Backup ✅

- Runs `backup.sh` on server
- Creates PostgreSQL and Dragonfly backups
- Uploads to Contabo S3 (dual-backup strategy)
- Returns `BACKUP_ID` as output
- S3 credentials passed via environment variables

### 4. Debug ✅

- Runs `diagnose.sh` on server
- Attempts auto-fix
- Sets output: `debug-status` (fixed/failed)
- Only runs if `infra-unhealthy` AND `infra-changed == false`

### 5. Recreate Infrastructure ✅

- Stops existing containers gracefully
- Recreates with `docker compose --profile infrastructure up -d`
- Waits for containers to start
- Only runs if `infra-changed == true` OR (`infra-unhealthy` AND `debug-failed`)

### 6. Restore ✅

- Runs `restore.sh` with `BACKUP_ID`
- Restores from local backup first, falls back to S3
- Only runs if backup was created (`backup-infrastructure.result == 'success'`)

### 7. Verify ✅

- Runs `verify.sh` on server
- Verifies infrastructure health, data integrity, application readiness
- Only runs after recreate/restore operations

### 8. Build Application ✅

- Only runs if `app-changed == true`
- Uses images already built in `docker-build` job
- No separate build needed (build happens in Docker)

### 9. Deploy ✅

- Copies all scripts to server
- Sets up directories
- Sets environment variables including `INFRA_ALREADY_HANDLED`
- Calls `deploy.sh` which:
  - Skips infrastructure operations if `INFRA_ALREADY_HANDLED == true`
  - Only handles application deployment
  - Verifies final state

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Main Entry Point

```bash
# Local development
./healthcare.sh dev docker start

# Docker production
./healthcare.sh docker deploy
./healthcare.sh docker health-check
./healthcare.sh docker backup
./healthcare.sh docker restore latest

# Kubernetes (when implemented)
./healthcare.sh k8s deploy production
```

### Direct Script Usage

```bash
# Docker infrastructure scripts
./docker-infra/deploy.sh
./docker-infra/health-check.sh
./docker-infra/backup.sh
./docker-infra/restore.sh latest
./docker-infra/diagnose.sh
./docker-infra/verify.sh
./docker-infra/setup-directories.sh
```

### Standalone Mode (Manual Deployment)

`deploy.sh` can be run manually without CI/CD:

```bash
export INFRA_CHANGED=true
export APP_CHANGED=true
export INFRA_HEALTHY=true
export INFRA_ALREADY_HANDLED=false  # or don't set it
./docker-infra/deploy.sh
```

This is useful for:

- Manual deployments
- Testing
- Recovery scenarios
- Local development
